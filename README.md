# Mean-Median-Mode Number's in the List
The Mean is the average of the given numbers.
It is calculated by dividing the sum of the given numbers by the total count of numbers.
For example, numbers = 10,2,31,4
• Sum of the numbers 10, 2, 31 and 4 is 47
• Count of the numbers is 4.
• Mean of the numbers 10, 2, 31 and 4 is 11.75
(10/4 = 11.75 ).

Median is the middle value of the given numbers, where the numbers should be in ascending order.
For example, if the numbers are 1,9,4,7,2
• The numbers should be arranged in ascending order 1, 2, 4, 7, 9.
The count of numbers is 5. So, the middle number is the third number.

Mode is the number that occurs more times than other numbers in the list.
For example, if the given list of numbers are 6, 3, 9, 3, 6,
6, 5, 9, 3,
The number 6 occurred 3 times.
The number 3 occurred 3 times.
The number 9 occurred 2 times.
The number 5 occurred 1 time.
The Modes are 6 and 3, as they occurred more times than the other numbers in the given list.
If there are multiple modes, print the mode that occurs first in the given numbers.
